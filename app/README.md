trainingwheels.github.com
=========================

The generated gettrainingwheels.org website. Changes go in the repo gettrainingwheels.org.

How to build this site
----------------------

This site is generated by yeoman build. The yeoman build overwrites the full directory into which it's built so therefore we need to copy the build files from the yeoman output into the repo.

1. If you haven't checked out this repo do so in the same folder you have the gettrainingwheels.org repo checked out in. From your trainingwheels.org checkout:
```bash
cd ../
git clone git@github.com:trainingwheels/trainingwheels.github.com.git
```
2. Run the `yeoman build` command.
3. Clear out the files from the previous build, then copy the contents of the `dist` build folder to the repo you checked out, and add the changes to a new commit. There may be some file deletions.
```bash
rm -Rf ../trainingwheels.github.com/*
cp -Rf dist/* ../trainingwheels.github.com
cd ../trainingwheels.github.com
git add -u
```
4. Confirm the changes commit and push.
```bash
git status
git commit -m "[your update message]"
```
